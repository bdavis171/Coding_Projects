            <p id='death'>A monsterous figure stands before you. Your body feels frozen as you stare into its glowing,
                red eyes. Before you can say a word, the beast lashes at you with its claws, giving out a terrifying
                roar... You have died, but I suppose you deserve a second chance!</p>
