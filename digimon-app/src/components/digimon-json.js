One of the 'Royal Knights', it is a being containing contradictions, as it is called a guardian deity of the Net despite being a Virus attribute, and if by any chance its balance is lost, it is possible for it to become a dangerous being. It pilots the Flying Dragon machine 'Grani', as a dragon knight that races across the skies.[6] It is clad in holy armor refined and constructed from 99.9% pure Chrome Digizoid, and its right hand can become the holy lance 'Gram', rivaled only by Darkdramon's 'Gigastick Lance', while its left hand can become the holy shield 'Aegis'. It honors chivalry, and is a loyal vassal towards its lord.",

There is a clear distinction between it and other Digimon in terms of existence or ability. Also, Imperialdramon is called the Dragon Mode, but there seems to exist a 'Fighter Mode' (竜人形態ファイターモード Ryuujin KeitaiFaitā Mōdo?, lit. 'Dragon Man Form') that is able to liberate all of its power. However, it is said that that form has never been seen. Due to its immense power, controlling it is next to impossible, and depending on how it is raised, it may become a savior or a god of destruction. It wields the 'Positron Laser' on its back.",
